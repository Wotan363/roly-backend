How does openAI does it because I can't just send endlessly chats in there 
right?
so maybe we need a mechanism that checks the token input and then leaves
out old stuff so it fits into the ai.

if we are super advanced then we can store the whole information of the
conversation (the whole context and info that the ai needs) into a 
database so the ai gives really good results
